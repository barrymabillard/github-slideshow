"The killing and eating of animals occurs mainly because people are convinced, that animals were created by God to be used by man, and that there is nothing wrong with killing animals. But this is false. In whatever books it is written that it is not a sin to kill animals, it is written in the hearts of all of us,  more clearly than in books, that an animal deserves compassion in the same way a human does, and we all know this, but we silence our conscience." -Leo Tolstoy (https://thevegandatabase.com/30-quotes-leo-tolstoy-animal-rights/)
